# Time Series Traffic Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on **time series forecasting** to predict website traffic trends using statistical models like **ARIMA**. The goal is to analyze historical traffic data and forecast future trends, which can be used for resource planning and decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
- **ARIMA Modeling**: Built and trained an ARIMA model to forecast traffic counts.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used **MAE** and **RMSE** to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Plotted actual vs. predicted values for clear insights.
- **Actionable Insights**: Derived insights to support business decisions.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based environment for running code
- **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting

## Dataset
The dataset contains daily website traffic counts over a period of time. It includes:
- `timestamp`: Date and time of the traffic count.
- `traffic_count`: Number of visits recorded.

(Note: Replace the dataset description with your actual dataset details.)

## Results
- **MAE**: X.XX  
- **RMSE**: Y.YY  
- Visualizations of actual vs. predicted traffic counts.

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced models like **Prophet** or **LSTM**.
- Incorporate external features (e.g., holidays, marketing campaigns) for improved accuracy.
